# Linus-Bot-Tips
A truly state-of-the-art, almost all-purpose bot made by a chump. Looking for the code of the marvelous Linus Bot Tips? Here it is!
 
Well, what can Linus Bot Tips do?
- It has an economy system.
- It has image manipulation commands.
- Remember that economy system I mentioned? It also has a Reddit-inspired leaderboard system hooked up to it.
- It has soundboard commands.
- It can play music.
- It has Discord Together capabilities (thanks to https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord-together)
- It also has something called AntiPhisher, which detects phishing links and deletes them. Those incidents can also be logged, if you choose that option. (Big thanks to https://github.com/nikolaischunk/stop-discord-phishing for this beauty.)
- Many more things, such as allowing you to commit money laundering.

Why should you get Linus Bot Tips?
Because it's good, simple as.
